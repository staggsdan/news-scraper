I followed the guide for pairing my mLab mongodb with a heroku deployment and it didn't work -- would love to connect with a TA on this for five minutes before the 5pm cutoff because I see this one of the most critical things for me to personally nail down. In the server.js you'll see the tweaked boilerplate I originally tried as well as the version I tried second from the PDF guide that was slacked out. Let me know!
